I have tried to create a website that holds my portfolio.

As a training web devopler I want future employers to be able view my work history and information about me on my webpage

I have included an About Me, Work and Contact Me section using some of the skills I have learnt from my current course.

I have input a border 

Sections for article and paragrephs.

I have set up my header at the top of the page and Footer at the bottom of the page.

I have attempted to add links that will guide you to each section of the page but have not been successful at this point but will work on this throughout the course period and after to improve this webpage.

I am aiming to add pictures to the background as well as responsive features to my webpage.

I am currently looking on the MDN webpage to assist with building my page to improve the ;ayout and key functions
